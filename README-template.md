## Overview

This is my solution for the News homepage challenge.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I built this website using the mobile first approach. And I also built it using the component based approach.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I will continue refining my layout skills as i am not still perfect in laying elements out using the
grid layout. Also I will continue learning JavaScript because my foundation in it isn't set quite yet.
I'm a beginner afterall.
